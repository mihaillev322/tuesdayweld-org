<summary>How do I verify Tuesday Weld filmography details?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Verifying Tuesday Weld filmography details requires cross-checking information across multiple reputable sources. The most reliable approach combines consultation of established film archives, library catalogues, and major publications with a track record of editorial rigour. Primary sources include the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Library of Congress</a>, which maintains comprehensive catalogues of American film and television, and university library systems that provide access to peer-reviewed film studies databases. International audiences can also consult resources such as the British Film Institute and national film archives in their respective countries, many of which maintain cross-referenced filmographies.</p>
<p>When evaluating sources, prioritise those with transparent editorial processes and institutional backing. For example, academic databases accessible through .edu domains often include citations and cross-references that allow for independent verification. Similarly, established cultural institutions with .org or .gov domains typically adhere to rigorous standards of accuracy. Be cautious of user-generated content platforms, which may contain errors or unverified claims; instead, use such platforms as a starting point and confirm details through authoritative sources. For a detailed explanation of the sourcing hierarchy used in this guide, see the <a href="/about-us">how we verify filmography</a> page.</p>
<p>Practical steps for verification include comparing release dates, production companies, and cast lists across at least three independent sources. Pay attention to discrepancies in titles, which may reflect regional distribution differences or re-releases. For television work, consult broadcast archives and Emmy or Golden Globe records, which provide official documentation of nominations and awards. By adopting a systematic approach and prioritising reputable sources, you can build a reliable understanding of Tuesday Weld's filmography and avoid perpetuating misinformation.</p>

<summary>What does "classic Hollywood" mean in this guide?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>In this guide, "classic Hollywood" is used as historical and stylistic shorthand to refer to the studio system era and its immediate aftermath, roughly spanning the 1930s through the 1960s. The term denotes a set of production practices, aesthetic conventions, and star systems that characterised American cinema during this period, rather than a strict chronological cutoff. Classic Hollywood is associated with the dominance of major studios such as MGM, Warner Bros., and Paramount, which controlled production, distribution, and exhibition through vertical integration. It also encompasses the narrative and visual styles codified during this era, including continuity editing, genre conventions, and the star system that shaped public reception of actors.</p>
<p>Tuesday Weld's career began during the final years of the classic Hollywood studio system and continued through the transition to New Hollywood in the late 1960s and 1970s. As such, her work provides a valuable case study in how actors navigated changing industry structures and aesthetic norms. When this guide refers to Tuesday Weld as a classic Hollywood actress or vintage film actress, it acknowledges both her chronological place within this historical period and her engagement with the performance traditions and narrative conventions associated with it. The term is not intended to imply a rigid boundary but rather to situate her work within a recognisable cultural and industrial context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Film historians and cultural institutions define classic Hollywood with reference to specific production practices, censorship regimes (notably the Production Code), and the economic structures of the studio system. For authoritative definitions and historical context, consult resources such as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> and scholarly publications available through university libraries and film institutes. These sources provide detailed analyses of the period's defining characteristics and its legacy in contemporary cinema.</p>
